System Optimization Model

	batCapCal.m - computes the necessary Battery bank for a given 
	PV array and desired LEGP. This is called upon by pvBatopt.m 
	to actually produce the battery vs. PV 
		inputs
		- I_C - yearly insolation profile on collector
		- demand - 8760 x 1 vector which is the yearly demand profile (W). 
		- pvCap - nominal PV capacity (W)
		- LEGP - desired LEGP (single number)
		- batStep - step by which to adjust PV capacity
		- batMin - minimum allowable battery energy (W-hr)
	pvBatOpt.m - is the main optimization algorithm is calls on
	SuppDemSum.m  and batCapCal.m
		inputs:
		- I_C - yearly insolation profile on collector
		- demand - 8760 x 1 vector which is the yearly demand profile (W). 
		- pvCap - nominal PV capacity (W)
		- batCap - maximum allowable battery energy (W-hr)
		- batMin - minimum allowable battery energy (W-hr)
	pvBatOptf.m - is the same algorithm as pvBatOpt.m but in function
	form. The function requires four inputs. 
	These are dates, weathVec, demVec, LEGPVec
		-dates - is a 8760x4 array. It contains year, month, day, hour. pvBatOptf.m
		adds the minute and second columns so that Matlab translates the dates
		correctly into numeric form.
		-I_C- is a 8760 x 1 vector. It is a yearly insolation profile on the 
		collector at hourly measurements 
		-demVec - is a 8760 x1 vector. It is the yearly demand profile recorded 
		at hourly intervals. 
		-LEGPVec - is the vector which represents the range of LEGPs in which 
		system performance will be analyzed. 

	resourceCalc.m - computes takes the insolation data and converts
	that into the net insolation w/m^2 on the collector.
		Edited on 07082012 corrected so that phi_c and L are converted into
		radians.
		
	SuppDemSum.m - given PV capacity and Battery capacity this 
	outputs the LEGP of the system. This is used by pvBatOpt.m
	to compute the minimum pv panel size that is necessary to meet
	a specified LEGP, when there is a nearly infinite battery bank
		
	testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m - specifies the four inputs which are 
	necessary to run pvBatOptf.m. It also calls upon pvBatOptf.m 
	to run the energy balance and optimization algorithms 
	for multiple weather profiles and locations at the same time.
		-The inputs are the date range (8760 x 4 array), the solar resource
		profiles (8760 x (number of profiles) array), the demand profile 
		(8760 x 1 vector), and the range of LEGPs (vector).
		-Output is a three dimensional matrix length(LEGPs) x 6 x # of solar resource
		profiles. This matrix is called bestMultiLoc. 
		
	testSingleWeathPvBatOpt.m - this is the same script as testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m 
	except that it only runs pvBatOpt.m for a single weather profile and provides
	a 2D array as an output. It specifies the four inputs which are 
	necessary to run pvBatOptf.m. It also calls upon pvBatOptf.m 
	to run the energy balance and optimization algorithms 
	for one weather profile/location.
		-The inputs are the date range (8760 x 4 array), the solar resource
		profiles (8760 x 1 vector), the demand profile 
		(8760 x 1 vector), and the range of LEGPs (vector).
		-Output is a two dimensional matrix length(LEGPs) x 6.
		This matrix is called bestMultiLoc. 
	This was modified so that it can conduct the simulation for two different 
	demand profiles in one run.

	energyDir.m - A function that is called upon by makeLEGPHistogram. 
	calculates the about of generated energy goes directly into 
	meeting demand. This is to assess the relative importance of the 
	battery bank when comparing different systems. 
	The inputs are supply and demand. The output is a 8760 x 1 vector
	of the energy that goes directly from the PV to the load without 
	first being stored in the battery bank. This function is not 
	100 percent accurate because the simulation is conducted 
	on an hourly time scale. However, this sould provide insight as to 
	how much the system is relying on the batttery bank.

	makeAveDay.m - creates a variable called aveDays. This function makes an average
	hourly day of demand data from one week of demand data.  

	makeEnerBalancePlot.m - creates an energy balance plot of one week 
	of data series. The week starts on the second day of the year.
	On the plot are supply, demand, and battery charge state. 
	This script was used to create energyBalance.fig and energyBalance.pdf.

	makeIsoReliaPlot.m - creates an isoReliability plot of PV capacity versus 
	battery capacity. Superimposd on the plot is the cost of each generation
	and storage combination. Reliability is measured as LEGP and cost is 
	measured as USD/kWhr.

	makeLEGPHistorgram.m - a modified version of testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m. Produces
	two bar subplots within a single larger plot. The first bar plot is 
	of the hourly LEGP over the course of the year, for the demand profile with 
	refrigerator base load. The second bar plot is for the demand profile without
	the refrigerator base load. The are conducted for yearly LEGPs of 0.01 and 0.05.
	Also added on the script is the calculation of enDirPercF and enDirPercL. These
	are the percentage of the energy that went directly from the PV to the load without
	being stored in the battery bank.

		-Hourly bar plot - The hourly LEGP for two different yearly LEGPs. 
		The values for the bar plot are stored in the array LEGPHourly. Superimposed
		is a line plot of the hourly energy demand. The line plot has its scale defined
		on the right side of the figure. The line plot is made by calling on the 
		function makeAveDay.m. Superimpose on the plot is the mean hourly demand.
		
		- By commenting/uncommenting out two blocks of text, the hourly LEGP bar plot 
		can be made just for the month of August. The month of August corresponds to
		the hours of 5089 to 5832
			
		
	makeLEGPHistorgramM.m - a modified version of testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m. Produces
	two bar subplots within a single larger plot. The first bar plot is 
	of the monthly LEGP over the course of the year, for the demand profile with 
	refrigerator base load. The second bar plot is for the demand profile without
	the refrigerator base load. The are conducted for yearly LEGPs of 0.01 and 0.05.

		-monthly bar plot - The monthly LEGP for two different yearly LEGPs. 
		The values for the bar plot are stored in the array LEGPmonthly. Superimposed
		is a line plot of the monthly energy demand. The line plot has its scale defined
		on the right side of the figure. The line plot is made by calling on the 
		function makeMonthlyRad.m. Superimposed on the plot is the net monthly insolation.

	makeLEGMap.m - is a matlab function called upon by makeLEGPHistogram.m. It produces
	a heatmap of LEP. One the y-axis is the day number. On the x-axis is the hour
	of the day. Cells are colored based on the magnitude of the LEG. 
	The function requires two inputs. The inputs are LEG and Hours. The output is a 
	figure called LEGMap. This function can be used to create non-full year LEGMaps.
	These must be made for entire days. 
		
	makeMonthlyRad.m - takes in the hourly date stamps for a year and the corresponding 
	insolation on the collector. The function then finds the sum of insolation for 
	each month. This is returned as I_monthly.  

	makeSynthDemYear.m - creates two year long hourly demand profiles. Each
	is a 8760 x 1 vector. Within each of the two data sets every day is identical. The 
	first vector created is called fridgeDemandYearSyn. Within fridgeDemandYearSyn hours 
	between 1AM and 6PM have a demand of 250 watts. Between 6PM and 1AM there is a demand 
	of 400 watts. The second vector is called lightDemandYearSyn.m. Between 6PM and 1AM 
	there is a demand of 150 watts. At all other watts there is no demand. These vectors 
	are saved as a .mat file called synthDem.mat
