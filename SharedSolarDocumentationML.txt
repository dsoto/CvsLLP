System Optimization Model

pvBatOpt.m - is the main optimization algorithm is calls on
SuppDemSum.m  and batCapCal.m

SuppDemSum.m - given PV capacity and Battery capacity this 
outputs the LEGP of the system. This is used by pvBatOpt.m
to compute the minimum pv panel size that is necessary to meet
a specified LEGP, when there is a nearly infinite battery bank

batCapCal.m - computes the necessary Battery bank for a given 
PV array and desired LEGP. This is called upon by pvBatopt.m 
to actually produce the battery vs. PV curve

resourceCalc.m - computes takes the insolation data and converts
that into the net insolation w/m^2 on the collector.

makeAveDay.m - creates a variable called aveDays. This function makes an average
hourly day of demand data from one week of demand data.  

makeSynthDemYear.m - creates two year long hourly demand profiles. Each
is a 8760 x 1 vector. Within each of the two data sets every day is identical. The 
first vector created is called fridgeDemandYearSyn. Within fridgeDemandYearSyn hours 
between 1AM and 6PM have a demand of 250 watts. Between 6PM and 1AM there is a demand 
of 400 watts. The second vector is called lightDemandYearSyn.m. Between 6PM and 1AM 
there is a demand of 150 watts. At all other watts there is no demand. These vectors 
are saved as a .mat file called synthDem.mat

.mat files (Data Sets)

ML05_ML06_UGProfile.mat - This is a bundle of arrays that are used
to run the system optimization model. It contains: 
	-NTS solar data 
		-Mali, Kisangani, Luxor, and Nouakchott.
	-ML05 demand data *Parasitic Load not removed*
		-lightDemandWeek - hourly data for one week
		-lightDemandYear - lightDemandWeek propogated out to a full year.
		-lightDemandDaily - lightDemandYear compressed into daily resolution
	-ML06 demand data *Parasitic Load not removed*
		-fridgeDemandWeek - hourly data for one week
		-fridgeDemandYear - fridgeDemandWeek propogated out to a full year.
		-fridgeDemandDaily - fridgeDemandYear compressed into daily resolution 
		
aveDayfridgeDemand.mat - was created by aveDays.
	 contains:
		-aveDays - fridgeDemandWeek averaged on an hourly basis to make a
				representative day of electricity demand.

synthDem.mat - was created by makeSynthYear.m - It contains synthetic electricity
demand data characteristic of ML05 and ML06.
	-  fridgeDemandYearSyn. Within fridgeDemandYearSyn hours between 1AM and 6PM 
	have a demand of 250 watts. Between 6PM and 1AM there is a demand of 400 watts.
	-	lightDemandYearSyn.m. Between 6PM and 1AM there is a demand of 150 watts. 
	During other hours there is no demand.
