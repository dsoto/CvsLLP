System Optimization Model

batCapCal.m - computes the necessary Battery bank for a given 
PV array and desired LEGP. This is called upon by pvBatopt.m 
to actually produce the battery vs. PV 
	inputs
	- I_C - yearly insolation profile on collector
	- demand - 8760 x 1 vector which is the yearly demand profile (W). 
	- pvCap - nominal PV capacity (W)
	- LEGP - desired LEGP (single number)
	- batStep - step by which to adjust PV capacity
	- batMin - minimum allowable battery energy (W-hr)
pvBatOpt.m - is the main optimization algorithm is calls on
SuppDemSum.m  and batCapCal.m
	inputs:
	- I_C - yearly insolation profile on collector
	- demand - 8760 x 1 vector which is the yearly demand profile (W). 
	- pvCap - nominal PV capacity (W)
	- batCap - maximum allowable battery energy (W-hr)
	- batMin - minimum allowable battery energy (W-hr)
pvBatOptf.m - is the same algorithm as pvBatOpt.m but in function
form. The function requires four inputs. 
These are dates, weathVec, demVec, LEGPVec
	-dates - is a 8760x4 array. It contains year, month, day, hour. pvBatOptf.m
	adds the minute and second columns so that Matlab translates the dates
	correctly into numeric form.
	-I_C- is a 8760 x 1 vector. It is a yearly insolation profile on the 
	collector at hourly measurements 
	-demVec - is a 8760 x1 vector. It is the yearly demand profile recorded 
	at hourly intervals. 
	-LEGPVec - is the vector which represents the range of LEGPs in which 
	system performance will be analyzed. 

resourceCalc.m - computes takes the insolation data and converts
that into the net insolation w/m^2 on the collector.
	Edited on 07082012 corrected so that phi_c and L are converted into
	radians.
	
SuppDemSum.m - given PV capacity and Battery capacity this 
outputs the LEGP of the system. This is used by pvBatOpt.m
to compute the minimum pv panel size that is necessary to meet
a specified LEGP, when there is a nearly infinite battery bank
	
testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m - specifies the four inputs which are 
necessary to run pvBatOptf.m. It also calls upon pvBatOptf.m 
to run the energy balance and optimization algorithms 
for multiple weather profiles and locations at the same time.
	-The inputs are the date range (8760 x 4 array), the solar resource
	profiles (8760 x (number of profiles) array), the demand profile 
	(8760 x 1 vector), and the range of LEGPs (vector).
	-Output is a three dimensional matrix length(LEGPs) x 6 x # of solar resource
	profiles. This matrix is called bestMultiLoc. 
	
testSingleWeathPvBatOpt.m - this is the same script as testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m 
except that it only runs pvBatOpt.m for a single weather profile and provides
a 2D array as an output. It specifies the four inputs which are 
necessary to run pvBatOptf.m. It also calls upon pvBatOptf.m 
to run the energy balance and optimization algorithms 
for one weather profile/location.
	-The inputs are the date range (8760 x 4 array), the solar resource
	profiles (8760 x 1 vector), the demand profile 
	(8760 x 1 vector), and the range of LEGPs (vector).
	-Output is a two dimensional matrix length(LEGPs) x 6.
	This matrix is called bestMultiLoc. 

other .m files

makeAveDay.m - creates a variable called aveDays. This function makes an average
hourly day of demand data from one week of demand data.  

makeEnerBalancePlot.m - creates an energy balance plot of one week 
of data series. The week starts on the second day of the year.
On the plot are supply, demand, and battery charge state. 
This script was used to create energyBalance.fig and energyBalance.pdf.

makeLEGPHistorgram.m - a modified version of testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m. Produces
two bar plots. The first bar plot is of the hourly LEGP over the course of the year. 
The second bar plot is the monthly LEGP for an entire year. All plot formatting is 
contained within makeLEGHistorgram.m

	-Hourly bar plot - The hourly LEGP for two different yearly LEGPs. 
	The values for the bar plot are stored in the array LEGPHourly. Superimposed
	is a line plot of the hourly energy demand. The line plot has its scale defined
	on the right side of the figure. The line plot is made by calling on the 
	function makeAveDay.m.

	-monthly bar plot - The monthly LEGP for two different yearly LEGPs. 
	The values for the bar plot are stored in the array LEGPmonthly. Superimposed
	is a line plot of the monthly energy demand. The line plot has its scale defined
	on the right side of the figure. The line plot is made by calling on the 
	function makeMonthlyRad.m.

makeMonthlyRad.m - takes in the hourly date stamps for a year and the corresponding 
insolation on the collector. The function then finds the sum of insolation for 
each month. This is returned as I_monthly.  

makeSynthDemYear.m - creates two year long hourly demand profiles. Each
is a 8760 x 1 vector. Within each of the two data sets every day is identical. The 
first vector created is called fridgeDemandYearSyn. Within fridgeDemandYearSyn hours 
between 1AM and 6PM have a demand of 250 watts. Between 6PM and 1AM there is a demand 
of 400 watts. The second vector is called lightDemandYearSyn.m. Between 6PM and 1AM 
there is a demand of 150 watts. At all other watts there is no demand. These vectors 
are saved as a .mat file called synthDem.mat
