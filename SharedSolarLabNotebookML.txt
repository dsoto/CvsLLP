Goals
-Create Synthetic Demand Data. One of ML06 with a constant
refridgerator base load.
-Run synthetic data through optimization model. 

Completed
- makeSynthDemYear.m - creates synthetic hourly electricity demand. There are 
two cases, each of which is a one year (8760) vector.  The synthetic hourly 
demand is stored as a .mat file called synthDem.mat
	- fridgeDemandYearSyn
	- lightDemandYearSyn

Goals
-Partially functionalize pvBatOpt.m
-Run synthetic demand data (of system with and without refridgerator base load)
through the cost vs LEGP algorithm. Do this for Mali, Luxor, Kisangari,
and Nouakchott.

Completed Actions

pvBatOptf.m

-Created a new function called pvBatOptf.m which is a partially
functionalized version on pvBatOpt. The function requires three inputs. 
These are weathVec, demVec, LEGPVec
	-weathVec - is a 8760 x 1 vector. It is a yearly insolation profile at 
	hourly measurements 

	-demVec - is a 8760 x1 vector. It is the yearly demand profile recorded 
	at hourly intervals. 
	
	- LEGPVec - is the vector which represents the range of LEGPs in which 
	system performance will be analyzed. 
	
The output of pvBatOptf.m is an array called best.
	-best - has six columns. Its number of rows corresponds to the length
	of LEGPVec. In order from left to right, the columns correspond to the 
	following. Desired LEGP, the lowest cost option for the LEGP, the battery
	cost for the lowest cost option, the pv cost for the lowest cost option,
	the nominal battery capacity, and the nominal pv capacity. 
	
Variables which still must be specified within pvBatOptf.m and the associated 
functions.
	-pvStep - incrememtal step size that script adjusts PV bank
	-batStep - incrememtal step size that script adjusts battery bank
	-pvCost - cost per W of PV
	-batCost - cost per Wh of battery
	-batPerDis - allowable battery percent discharge.  
	
Variables that must be altered inside of BOTH SuppDemSum.m and BatCapCal.m
	-phi_c - collector azimuth
	-sigma - collector tilt angle from the ground level
	-Long - longitude
	-LTM - local time meriadian
	-rho - ground reflectance
