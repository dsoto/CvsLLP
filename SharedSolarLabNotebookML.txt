Goals
-Create Synthetic Demand Data. One of ML06 with a constant
refridgerator base load.
-Run synthetic data through optimization model. 

Completed
- makeSynthDemYear.m - creates synthetic hourly electricity demand. There are 
two cases, each of which is a one year (8760) vector.  The synthetic hourly 
demand is stored as a .mat file called synthDem.mat
	- fridgeDemandYearSyn
	- lightDemandYearSyn

07082012
Goals
-Partially functionalize pvBatOpt.m
-Run synthetic demand data (of system with and without refridgerator base load)
through the cost vs LEGP algorithm. Do this for Mali, Luxor, Kisangari,
and Nouakchott.

Completed Actions

pvBatOptf.m

-Created a new function called pvBatOptf.m which is a partially
functionalized version on pvBatOpt. The function requires three inputs. 
These are weathVec, demVec, LEGPVec
	-weathVec - is a 8760 x 1 vector. It is a yearly insolation profile at 
	hourly measurements 

	-demVec - is a 8760 x1 vector. It is the yearly demand profile recorded 
	at hourly intervals. 
	
	-LEGPVec - is the vector which represents the range of LEGPs in which 
	system performance will be analyzed. 
	
The output of pvBatOptf.m is an array called best.
	-best - has six columns. Its number of rows corresponds to the length
	of LEGPVec. In order from left to right, the columns correspond to the 
	following. Desired LEGP, the lowest cost option for the LEGP, the battery
	cost for the lowest cost option, the pv cost for the lowest cost option,
	the nominal battery capacity, and the nominal pv capacity. 
	
Variables which still must be specified within pvBatOptf.m and the associated 
functions.
	-pvStep - incrememtal step size that script adjusts PV bank
	-batStep - incrememtal step size that script adjusts battery bank
	-pvCost - cost per W of PV
	-batCost - cost per Wh of battery
	-batPerDis - allowable battery percent discharge.  
	
Variables that must be altered inside of BOTH SuppDemSum.m and BatCapCal.m
	-phi_c - collector azimuth
	-sigma - collector tilt angle from the ground level
	-Long - longitude
	-LTM - local time meriadian
	-rho - ground reflectance

Goals
-Need to run pvBatOptf.m for all of the locations. Need to complete this
for fridgeDemandSyn and lightDemandSyn. 

Completed Actions
-Modified pvBatOptf.m. It needed a fourth input for
the  dates. Dates can be entered as  a 8760 x 4 array. The extra columns for 
minutes and seconds are added by the function.  

-created testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m which specifies the four inputs 
which are necessary to run pvBatOptf.m. It also calls upon pvBatOptf.m 
to run the energy balance and optimization algorithms for multiple weather
profiles and locations at the same time.
	-The inputs are the date range (8760 x 4 array), the solar resource
	profiles (8760 x (number of profiles) array), the demand profile 
	(8760 x 1 vector), and the range of LEGPs (vector).
	-Output is a three dimensional matrix length(LEGPs) x 6 x # of solar resource
	profiles. This matrix is called bestMultiLoc. 
	
-created resourceSolTim1.mat
	-Contains the NTS solar resource profiles for Kisangani, Luxor, (Segou Mali), 
	and Nouakchott from the HelioClim3 database. These the solar
	data points are measured at True Solar Time.The data range is 1/1/2005
	to 12/31/2005. The ground reflectance (albeto) is 0.2. Data is 
	measured at Hourly Intervals. 
	-The locations of the cities were chosen using the search feature of the
	HelioClim/SoDa interface.
	The cordinates are (using G. Masters convention):
		-Segou, Mali, 13.45 Lat, 6.26 Long
		-Luxor, Egypt, 25.68 Lat, -32.65 Long
		-Kisangani, DRC, 0.51 Lat,-25.2 Long
		-Nouakchott, Mauritania, 18.08 Lat, 15.97 Long

Goals
-Fix pvBatOptf.m and associated files so that the coordinates of each location
can be updated. 
-Fix the weather data sets to get rid of gaps in data. 

Completed Actions
-Removed missing data points from resourceSolTim1.mat
CORRECTIONS FOR MISSING DATA
	All data missing from columns 5 through 11
	Kisangani, DRC
	rows 2574 through 2587. Replaced by 2550 through 2563
	rows 5646 through 5779. Replaced by 5502 through 5635
	rows 7903 through 7914. Replaced by 7879 through 7890
	Luxor, Egypt
	rows 2574 through 2587. Replaced by 2550 through 2563
	rows 5646 through 5779. Replaced by 5502 through 5635
	rows 7903 through 7914. Replaced by 7879 through 7890
	Segou, Mali
	rows 5646 through 5779. Replaced by 5502 through 5635
	Nouakchott, Mauritania
	rows 5646 through 5779. Replaced by 5502 through 5635

-Updated in the energy balance/optimization algorithm so that 
the Latitude of each of the locations is passed to resourceCal.m. 
A variable within testMultWeathPvBatOpt.m called lats must be 
specified. lats is a vector whose length is the same as the number of 
weather profiles. 

-Ran the energy balance/optimization algorithm for the following 
input parameters. The demand profiles came from synthDem.mat
and the resource profiles came from resourceSolTim1.mat
	dates = MaliNTS(:,1:4)
	weather = [MaliNTS(:,5),LuxorNTS(:,5),KisanganiNTS(:,5),NouakchottNTS(:,5)]
	lats = [13.45,25.68,0.51,18.08];
	demVec = fridgeDemandYearSyn;
	LEGPVec = 0.01:0.01:0.20;
The output was stored as bestMultiLoc1.mat. The array contained
within the .mat is also called bestMultiLoc1.
	
-Ran the energy balance/optimization algorithm with the same input 
parameters as the previous iteration. The demand profile was 
lightDemandYearSyn which also came from resourceSolTim1.mat. The 
result was stored as bestMultiLoc2.mat. The array contained
within the .mat is also called bestMultiLoc2.

-Plot the first two columns of bestMultiLoc1 and bestMultiLoc2
as cost per kWh vs LEGP plot. These ares saved as MultiLocCostvsLEGP1.fig 
and MultiLocCostvsLEGP2.fig respectively.

07142012 

Modified energy balance algorithm such that resourceCal is only called
upon once for each weather profile. testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m no longer
passes resource (normal to sun insolation) to the other scripts. Instead,
it passes I_C which is the insolation on the collector. pvBat no longer 
receives lats, because no solar geometry calculations are made within it. 
	
07172012

Created functions/ scripts to produce figures for WP02.tex. The scripts that
were created are:
	testSingleWeathPvBatOpt.m - This creates MaliFridgeCostPerkWhr.fig.
	
	makeLEGPHistogram.m - Used to created fully formated plots bar graphs for 
	WP02.tex. The first bar plot is of Hourly LEGP, with average demand
	superimposed on top of it. The second bar plot is of monthly LEGP with a 
	line plot of net monthly insolation (W/m^2) superimposed on it. 
		makeMonthlyRad.m (function for makeLEGPHistogram.m)

Also testMultiWeathPvBatOpt.m was utilized in order to create 
MWCostPerkWhVsLEGP0105. This a cost per kWh vs LEGP using fridgeDemandYear
and the weather profiles for [MaliNTS,LuxotNTS,KisanganiNTS];

07252012

Created makeEnerBalancePlot.m. This uses the energy balance and optimization
algorithms to produce an energy balance plot for the days 2 through 8 of the 
year. This script was used to create energyBalance.fig. 

energyBalance.fig -  This figure was created by makeEnerBalancePlot.m.
Energy balance algorithm calculations from January 2, 2005 until Jan 8, 2005. 
Simulation uses micro-grid demand with refrigerator base load
and insolation profile from Segou, Mali. Micro-grid contains 2500 W of nominal PV 
capacity, and 13000 W-hr of nominal battery capacity. Battery low charge disconnect
is 6500 W-hr. Y axis scale for electricity supply and demand is on the left 
side of the figure. Y axis scale for battery storage is on the right of figure.

07262012

Created makeIsoReliaPlot.m - creates an isoReliability plot of PV capacity
versus battery capacity. Superimposd on the plot is the cost of each generation
and storage combination. Reliability is measured as LEGP and cost is 
measured as USD/kWhr.
	-This script was used to create isoRelaibilityCurve.fig. This curve is for 
	an LEGP of 0.05 with a demand profile from fridgeDemandWeek from truDem.mat.
	Electricity supply was from MaliNTS from resourceSolTim1.mat
	- The plot is clipped so that battery capacity goes from 6000 to 20000 Whr
	with a spacing of 2000 Whr. PV demand goes from 0 to 7000 W with a spacing 
	of 1000 W. Costs are printed from 0 to 5 USD with a spacing of 0.50 USD.
	
	
07272012

To Do 

Do a cost versus LEGP curve for the micro-grid
with and without the refridgerator base load.
-See if  the knee in the curves are in the same 
place
-run TestSingleWeathPvBatOpt.m for both cases. 

Result. There is no knee in the curve. It has 
a shape that appears more parabolic. As a result,
I am going to look at the hourly bar plots for 
0.01 and 0.05 with and without the refridgerator
base load. 

I good teaching figure would be a bar graph
of monthly insolation in Mali. Perhaps this can 
lead the next sub-section.
	
Completed

Modified SuppDemSum.m to correct a mistake in the 
script. The first element batChar need to be changed to
batMin. This removes the occurance of a high LEGP
measurement at 2 AM.  

Modified TestSingleWeathPvBatOpt.m so that it produces
a USD/kWhr versus LEGP plot for two different demand 
profiles. The resulting plot is called 
MaliFandLCostPerkWhVsLEGP.pdf

07312012

Modified makeLEGPHistogram.m. The script was split into two separate scripts.
makeLEGPHistorgram.m only create the hourly LEGP bar plots. A second file 
called make LEGPHistogramM.m was created to make the monthly LEGP bar plots.
Both of the scripts have the added feature of makeing all bar plots for the 
demand profile with the refrigerator base load and the demand profile without
the refrigerator base load. 

A error in the monthly bar plot script was discovered and rectified. The LEGs were
accidently being sorted by day instead of month.
