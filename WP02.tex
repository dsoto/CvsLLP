\section{Introduction}
%% basic introduction
Many of the communities lacking electricity today share two challenges,
distance from the existing electrical grid and lack of access to capital
to create distributed generation.
The remoteness of these locations requires the use of off-grid power
which is often more expensive per watt of generation.
Since these communities do not have abundant capital to invest in power
production and storage, it is important to reduce the investment cost
which reduces the delivered cost of electricity.
Using measured and simulated weather and demand data we calculate the
generation and storage costs at a given level of reliability.
%% wasteful guidelines
Traditional guidelines regarding system autonomy can lead to systems
that are more expensive than necessary.
In order to provide a system that has excellent autonomy despite
variations in solar resource is expensive.
We investigate the trade-offs between increased reliability and
increased expense of generation and storage.
These curves allow a policy-maker or system installer to make informed
decisions about the predicted uptime of the system and the resulting
cost of the system.
If customers may be willing to go without service for a certain time period
each year, if the tariff is significantly lowered.

%% previous research
Previous research by Markvart and Egido and Lorenzo construct curves
that specify the locus of system sizes that satisfy a given LLP.
Their work does not specify the lowest cost point on each of the
iso-reliability curves.
%% how we build on previous research
This work adds an estimation of the lowest cost point for a given
reliability and allows us to construct a marginal cost of reliability
curve.
The shape of this reliability curve depends on the local weather
patterns as well as the load patterns.
This work demonstrates the differences in the shape of the cost vs.
reliability curve for different climates.
This allows a more accurate view of cost and autonomy than is available
from average monthly insolation data.




\section{Model}
The primary metric we use to evaluate a micro-grid's performance is called Lack of Energy to Generate Probability (LEGP) which was introduced by Wissem et al.\cite{}.
LEGP is equal to the demand that a micro-grid was unable to meet divided by the total demand over a specified time frame. 
For our model the time frame was 8760 hours, or one year. 
We express system reliability using an energy metric, instead of time based metrics such as Loss of Load Probability (LOLP), because of the highly variable demand profiles of offgrid communities. 
Within many of the off-grid communities observed a vast majority of electricity demand occurred during the few hours following sunset.
Electricity was used for applications such as lighting, television, and radio. 
LOLP does not accurately describe the quality of a microgrid's service when there are several hours per day when the microgrid is operational but there is little to no electricity demand. 
LOLP also fails to account for periods, such as during the late evening and early morning, when the microgrid is not operational but there is no electricity demand.

The model we created contains two basic levels.
% perhaps I can put in a little schematic which illustrates the different levels and their interaction
The inner level conducts an energy balance analysis on an hourly timescale.
This analysis simulates the production, storage, distribution, and consumption of energy in a village microgrid for each hour over the course of a year. 
The energy balance level is called upon by an script which computes all of the PV generation and battery storage combinations which satisfy a particular LEGP. 
This script then determines the generation and storage combination with the minimum initial capital investment cost. 
The optimization is then executed for several LEGPs, resulting in a cost vs. reliability plot.

\subsection{Energy Balance Algorithm}

The energy balance model requires two sets of time series data. 
The first is a vector of normal to sun insolation in \unit{W/m^2} for each hour of the year.
The second time series data set is of hourly electricity demand in \unit{W\cdot hr} throughout the year. 
Given the geographic coordinates of the micro-grid, the dates of the insolation measurements, and the ground reflectance of the location, we calculate the insolation on the collector, $I_C$, using the methodology outlined by Masters \cite{}. 
To convert available insolation into PV electricity generation, the nominal PV capacity, $P_{nom}$, must be specified by the model operator or an external script.
We estimate that the nominal PV capacity will only be reached at the maximum insolation value within the one year data set.

As seen in equation \ref{eq:A}, we then use a scaling factor, $ A_{pv}$ with units of \unit{m^2} to estimate the energy generated at all other times.  

\begin{equation} \label{eq:A}
A_{pv} = \frac{max(I_C)}{P_{nom}}
\end{equation}

Then as equation \ref{eq:EPV} illustrates, the generated energy, $E_{pv}$, is linearly scaled at all times, $t$, according to available insolation.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:EPV}
E_{pv}(t) = A_{pv} \cdot I_C(t)
\end{equation}

In order to conduct the one year simulation,the maximum and minimum allowable battery charge levels $E_{Bmin}$ and $E_{Bmax}$ must be specified in \unit{W\cdot hr}.
We then compute the charge level of the battery bank for all hours using equation \ref{eq:ESUM}. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ESUM}
E_B(t+1) =
\begin{cases}
E_{Bmax} & \text{if } E_B(t+1) \geq E_{Bmax},\\
E_B (t) + E_{pv} (t) - E_{dem} (t) & \text{if } E_{Bmin}\geq E_B(t+1)\leq E_{Bmax},\\
E_{Bmin} & \text{if } E_B(t) \leq E_{Bmin}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

When the battery capacity has been depleted, we quantify the demand that cannot be met using a variable called Lack of Energy to Generate, $LEG$, which was proposed by Wissem et al. \cite{ }. 
We define $LEG$ using equation \ref{eq:LEG}. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:LEG}
LEG(t) = E_{dem} (t) - (E_{pv} (t)+E_B(t-1)-E_{Bmin})
\end{equation}

We are then able to assess the micro-grid's performance using $LEGP$ which is calculated using equation \ref{eq:LEGP}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:LEGP}
LEGP = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^T LEG(t)}{\sum_{t=1}^T E_{dem} (t)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optimization Algorithm}

The optimization algorithm calls upon the energy balance algorithm to find all of the PV generation and battery storage combinations which satisfy a desired $LEGP$. This algorithm can be applied to a range of $LEGPs$ to understand how system reliability influences the consumer cost of electricity. We must specify several inputs in order to utilize the optimization algorithm. The inputs are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The range of $LEGPs$ on which to perform system optimization
\item The incremental step sizes by which the battery bank and the PV array are allowed to change
\item The weather and electricity demand data which are called upon by the energy summation algorithm
\item The cost per watt of installed PV capacity and the cost per Whr of installed battery capacity. 
\end{itemize}

For a specified LEGP, the algorithm first finds the smallest PV module which will achieve the LEGP when given a very large battery bank i.e(with a capacity which is 100 times the peak electricity demand). 
Then the algorithm increases the PV generation capacity, $P_{nom}$,by a fixed step size, $P_{step}$.
With the increased $P_{nom}$, the algorithm recalculates the battery bank capacity, $E_{Bmax}$, which is necessary to satisfy the desired LEGP.
The algorithm continues to increase PV generation until $E_{Bmax}$ ceases to change. 
It is important to note that due to the incremental step sizes of PV and battery capacity, the achieved LEGP of the system will always be lower than the specified value. 
Once we have a comprehensive list of PV and battery options which satisfy a desired LEGP, the optimization algorithm computes the cost per \unit{W\cdot hr} of electricity for each system combination.

If a range of $LEGPs$ is specified, the optimization algorithm only stores the lowest cost system combination for each $LEGP$. 
From that we are able to plot the cost versus reliability of the system. 
From the cost per \unit{kW\cdot hr} plot, and the associated data matrices, we are able to study how reliability drives system costs in various climates with varying demand profiles. 

\section{Results}

The results presented were obtained by using the demand profile of a micro-grid near Segou, Mali, which encompasses twenty households.
The micro-grid currently relies on 1.4 \unit{kW} of nominal PV capacity, and 17.280 \unit{kW\cdot hr} of lead acid battery storage.
The households use electricity primarily for nighttime lighting.
Also on the micro-grid is a 250 liter freezer which provides the micro-grid with a base demand of approximately 250 W. 
Peak demand on the micro-grid is approximately 450 W. 
The consumer demand data was created by propagating a single week of demand over an entire year.
There is a scarcity of hourly ground based insolation data for locations such as Segou, Mali, which are best served by isolated micro-grids. 
Thus, all insolation measurements were extrapolated from the HelioClim 3 database. The utilized HelioClim 3 data is of normal to sun insolation on the ground level.
HelioClim 3 data is derived from Meteosat Second Generation satellite images. 

Analysis and on the ground observation indicate that the micro-grid is electricity generation limited. 
Below in figure \ref{pvBat5} is a one year time series of the current system using the aforementioned energy balance algorithm.
The $LEGP$ of the micro-grid is 8.14 percent.

\subsection{Cost vs LEGP Curve}

For the purpose of economic modeling, the initial capital cost of PV installation was estimated as 1.50 \unit{USD/W}.
The capital cost of battery installation was 0.20 \unit{USD/W\cdot hr}. 
The cost of the PV will be repaid using a 20 year loan with an interest rate of 10 percent. 
The repayment period for the batteries is 3 years at an interest rate of 10 percent. 
This results in annual cost of 0.1762 \unit{USD/W} of PV capacity and an annual cost of 0.0804 \unit{USD/W\cdot hr}.
The metric used to evaluate the system cost was the break even retail electricity cost in \unit{USD/kWh}. This was found by dividing the annual payment cost by the number of \unit{kW\cdot hr} produced.

When running optimization algorithm, the nominal PV system capacity was allowed to be adjusted in increments of 100 W. 
Similarly, the battery storage could be adjusted in increments of 100 \unit{W\cdot hr}.
The minimum energy disconnect was chosen as 50 percent of the nominal battery capacity.
Also, the initial battery charge state was chosen as the minimum energy disconnect.
The cost versus $LEGP$ curve for this analysis is illustrated as figure \ref{CostVLEGPMali}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[trim = 10mm 70mm 10mm 70mm, clip,width=.85\textwidth]{MaliFridgeCostPerkWhVsLEGP}
  \caption{Cost vs. LEGP of Micro-Grid in Segou, Mali}
  \label{CostVLEGPMali}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{CostVLEGPMali} clearly illustrates that there are two distinct regimes on the cost vs $LEGP$ plot. 
The first is the linear portion of figure \ref{CostVLEGPMali} corresponding to $ 0.05 \lesssim LEGP \leq 0.20$. 
The second resembles an exponential function and corresponds to $ 0.01 \leq LEGP \lesssim 0.05$. 
The linear region corresponds to decreasing the $LEGP$ associated diurnal day-night solar behavior. 
The exponential region corresponds to eliminating the $LEGP$ associated with rainy periods.
Because there are scattered rainy periods which can last for several days, large increases in PV and battery capacity are needed to marginally decrease $LEGP$.
% I need to figure out how to best correlate the two portions of the curve with the diurnal and seasonal resource availability

When making necessary trade offs between cost and quality of service, figure \ref{CostVLEGPMali} indicates that the micro-grid should be sized for a LEGP of approximately five percent.
Knowing such, we can further analyze the micro-grid composition with a LEGP of 0.05.
Figure \ref{pvBat5} illustrates the PV generation and battery storage combination which produce a LEGP of 0.05. 
Also illustrated is the cost per kWh in USD of each combination. 
As figure \ref{pvBat5} indicates, the minimum cost of 0.466 \unit{USD/kW\cdot hr} corresponds to a battery capacity of 7000 \unit{W\cdot hr} and a PV capacity of 1800 W.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\label{pvBat5}
\end{figure}

Now that a potential micro-grid composition has been specified, we can conduct further analysis using the energy balance algorithm in order to better understand the micro-grid's temporal behavior.
